In this article, I take a simple, real-life problem and analyze different solutions in Python, BigQuery and Q. The problem is magical in the sense that unraveling it leads us to discover nice areas of these two programming languages including vector operations, Einstein summation, adverbs and functional form of select statements. Each solution has lessons to learn that deepens our IT knowledge, especially if we consider performance aspects as well. I believe that people understand programming concepts better via examples.

Python and Q are two world-class, dynamic programming languages with many similarities and some interesting differences. Python is a general language with specialized libraries for different fields like web and mobile development or data analysis. Q is primarily used in the financial industry for data analysis and developing trading algorithms. On Wall Street, people often use these tools side-by-side, sporadically with R and Matlab.
